# Thermostat

Makers Academy - Week 6 Challenge

## The Project

* Build the business logic to model a simple thermostat
* Hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery
* Use JavaScript to fetch data from external sources and display on the page
* Use the Jasmine framework to Test-Drive Development

## Specification

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with an up function
* You can decrease the temperature with a down function
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
* You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
* You can see the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage (indicated with green), <= 25 is medium-usage (indicated with black), anything else is high-usage (indicated with red).
